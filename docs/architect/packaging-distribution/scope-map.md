**Status:** Historical architecture discussion map.
**Date:** 2026-09-04.
**Purpose:** Preserve the concern split that was promoted into
`docs/platform/packaging-distribution/**` without letting this old map compete
as the current navigation surface.

Packaging distribution is not one component. It cuts across bootstrap,
runtime payload, project semantics, host surfaces, state authority, skill/prose
materialization, runner autonomy, Rust migration, and product packaging
cleanliness.

This document maps those concerns to the architecture documents that should own
or reference them.

## 1. Concern Map

| Concern | Core Question | Primary Architecture Home | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Global bootstrap/control | What can the machine-level command install, repair, upgrade, or start? | `docs/platform/packaging-distribution/README.md` | `fgctl` owns bootstrap and machine services. It must not own project workflow semantics. |
| Project-local runtime payload | What exactly is installed into a project and how is it identified? | `docs/platform/packaging-distribution/README.md` | Includes CLI, host/runtime, legacy Node payload, Rust artifacts, runner, adapter, skills, agents, prose, docs, manifest, ledger. |
| Workspace/runtime/work-state topology | How do worktrees share release content and work-state authority without forcing one active runtime or dirtying/racing each other? | `../workspace-topology.md` | Critical for coding-domain worktree isolation. Release store, workspace activation, work-state coordination, and projections have different scopes. |
| Runtime identity records | How does a project prove which fgOS runtime it is running? | `docs/platform/packaging-distribution/architecture/runtime-identity-and-activation.md` | Central contract for version safety, activation, drift detection, downgrade refusal, rollback, and provider identity. |
| Init/doctor/repair | Which layer may create workspace state, materialize projections, repair config, or repair runtime files? | `docs/platform/packaging-distribution/README.md` | Target architecture removes `setup` as onboarding behavior; current `fgos setup` remains deprecated legacy compatibility until a compatibility-window decision retires it. `fgctl init/repair/upgrade` may change runtime identity; local `fgos init`, `fgos doctor --fix`, and final read-only `fgos doctor` operate under the installed identity. |
| Host-visible skills/agents/prose | Where does canonical workshop material live, and how does the host discover it? | `docs/platform/packaging-distribution/README.md`, `docs/architect/component-boundary/README.md` | Canonical source belongs to the local runtime payload; host-visible files are projections with ownership/fingerprint records. |
| Shared web dashboard | Is the web UI one shared surface or one per project? | `docs/platform/packaging-distribution/architecture/future-constraints.md`, later gateway/herdr architecture | Architecture constraint only for now; not active delivery scope. |
| Shared gateway front door | Is the gateway shared or per-project? | `docs/platform/packaging-distribution/architecture/future-constraints.md`, later gateway architecture | Architecture constraint only for now; not active delivery scope. |
| Project Runtime Adapter | Who translates stable web/chat command context into local project semantics? | `docs/platform/packaging-distribution/architecture/future-constraints.md`, `host-invocation-routing/*`, `docs/architect/component-boundary/README.md` | Adapter is versioned with the local project payload. Design enough now so packaging can carry it later; do not implement shared gateway/web now. |
| Host invocation/provider routing | How does a selected payload route an operation to Rust, legacy Node, runner, plugin, or external provider? | `host-invocation-routing/*` | Distribution selects the payload/adapter first; host invocation routes inside that payload. |
| Runner/autonomy payload | Which runner version drives a project? | `docs/platform/packaging-distribution/README.md`, runner architecture/spec later | A runner that mutates project state must come from the selected project's local payload/version. |
| Global daemon/MCP substrate | Which services may be global without owning project semantics? | `docs/platform/packaging-distribution/architecture/future-constraints.md`, later gateway/substrate architecture | Allowed direction: project registry, read-model cache, event/signal/mailbox/bus, process supervision. Not all fgOS verbs as MCP. |
| Rust host release | What artifact shape is needed before Rust becomes the installed public `fgos` entry? | `host-invocation-routing/*`, `docs/platform/packaging-distribution/README.md` | Rust R1 requires install/upgrade/rollback, compatibility payload placement, and payload identity. |
| fgOS self-development cleanliness | How does fgOS dogfood itself without dirtying the product package surface? | `docs/platform/packaging-distribution/README.md`, possibly later self-hosting note | This is a special case of local workshop files coexisting with product source in the same workspace. |
| Coexistence with other harnesses | How does install avoid overwriting another tool's hooks/skills/host files? | `docs/platform/packaging-distribution/README.md`, `docs/architect/component-boundary/README.md` | Preserve D-ADR0009: detect, yield, and require explicit ownership before writing shared host-visible paths. |

## 2. Historical Document Split

This discussion proposed the split below. The active promoted split now lives
under `docs/platform/packaging-distribution/**`.

```txt
docs/architect/
  workspace-topology.md
    repository/workspace/work-state identities, state classes, modes,
    operation-to-root matrix, lifecycle/failure modes, dirty-tree rules

docs/architect/packaging-distribution/
  README.md
    discussion spine and target model later promoted to platform docs

  scope-map.md
    this file; concern map and document routing

  runtime-identity-and-activation.md
    immutable release manifest, workspace activation binding, pin, projection
    ledger, migration journal outline, invocation lease, drift, rollback,
    quarantine

  future-constraints.md
    future shared web/gateway constraint, Project Runtime Adapter,
    out-of-process protocol, global substrate boundary

  history/distribution-baseline.md
    old Node/npm baseline and generated-spec fragments preserved as input

future optional splits, only when they outgrow runtime identity:
  fgctl-and-local-fgos-contract.md
  workshop-materialization.md
```

[Workspace Topology Architecture](../workspace-topology.md) must be read before
runtime identity, because packaging consumes topology rather than owning it.
[Runtime Identity And Activation](../../platform/packaging-distribution/architecture/runtime-identity-and-activation.md)
is the promoted first packaging-specific contract. Gateway/web itself is not
active delivery scope; its constraints live in
[Future Constraints](../../platform/packaging-distribution/architecture/future-constraints.md).

## 3. Boundary Rule

Use this rule to decide whether a detail belongs in packaging/distribution:

```txt
If the detail affects which fgOS payload is selected, trusted, materialized,
started, repaired, upgraded, or allowed to mutate a project, it belongs in
packaging/distribution.
```

Use this rule to decide whether it belongs elsewhere:

```txt
If the detail assumes the correct local payload is already selected, then it
probably belongs in host invocation, runner, work-state, agent coordination,
domainization, or gateway architecture instead.
```

Examples:

- "Where is `.fgos/runtime/bin/fgos` installed?" belongs to distribution.
- "Which provider handles `work.pick` after the local payload is selected?"
  belongs to host invocation/provider routing.
- "Can shared gateway accept a remote chat command for a project?" belongs to
  gateway/host surface later. For now, distribution only records the boundary
  so local payload shape does not make that impossible.
- "How does shared gateway translate that command into this project's semantic
  verb?" belongs to Project Runtime Adapter, currently recorded under
  distribution because it affects package shape.
- "Which event schema version is valid for this project?" belongs to
  work-state semantically, but distribution must record which local payload
  owns that schema.
- "Where do generated `.agents/skills` files come from?" belongs to
  workshop materialization under distribution.

## 4. Historical Architecture Position

The promoted direction captured from this old map is:

```txt
fgctl
  machine/global bootstrap and service control

shared web/dashboard
  future one human-visible surface for many projects
  not active delivery scope

shared gateway front door
  future stable remote/chat/UI command contract and project selection
  not active delivery scope

Project Runtime Adapter
  versioned with each project-local fgOS payload
  translates shared UI command context into local project semantics

project-local fgOS payload
  owns workflow semantics, state schema, runner version, skills/prose,
  doctor/init behavior, and provider routing for that project
```

The unresolved future deployment question is behind the shared gateway:

```txt
shared gateway front door
  -> per-request local process
  -> per-project worker process
  -> future project-local daemon
```

That execution choice should remain open until payload identity, adapter
contract, and repair semantics are clearer. Active delivery should focus on
project-local packaging/distribution and Rust `fgos` CLI correctness.

## 5. Activation Boundary

The activation-boundary shape captured here was:

```txt
acquire artifact
  -> stage immutable release in shared release store
  -> verify release manifest
  -> prepare workspace with candidate runtime
  -> publish ready workspace activation binding atomically
  -> allow project-state mutation
```

No project workflow command should run from a payload that has not crossed the
activation boundary. `fgctl` owns acquisition, staging, verification,
workspace binding publication, repair, upgrade, rollback, and quarantine.
Local `fgos` owns project semantics only after this workspace has a ready
activation binding and the runtime is write-compatible with the selected
work-state root.
